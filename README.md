This is a record of what was done for the incoming cohort 6 for the GU DSPP program. There was an 'asynchronous' portion throughout the summer (with mild/moderate participation), and an in-person event at the end of Foundations.

This repo represents a record (as much as practical) of all the materials.

The basic outline of the IRL portion was this:
	Intro (welcome, who we are, what to expect, ...)
	Solving Environments (R, RStudio, Python, Jupyter, etc....)
	Code-along (bitly links may or may not still work)
	Dr Ventura's talk
	Showing Survey results (from the Solving Environments slide)

We didn't get much feedback from our feedback survey, but some points worth considering are:

 - Have the code-along be slower, more in-depth, but at the end of everything so anybody who's bored can go home without missing anything
 - Have a "Meet us at Tombs after" or some other social gathering. People like to meet each other and chat.
 - Have fun notebooks to play with that are broken down into easy-medium-hard activities.
 - Have some activity of some sort (new? old? else?) that's broken down into small groups.
 - Send incoming students an email (during Foundations?) about what to bring (laptop!) and what to expect.
 - Have a "second-year DSPP student panel" / make sure all DSPP Foundations Fellows are present or visit.
 - Have an "in-person" module in Canvas that is locked until the day of the bootcamp (or maybe even the hour).




For the asynchronous work, we drew a lot from the (longer) DSAN bootcamp material that's a much more formalized summer session with due dates and such. It probably ended up roughly 60/40, old material to new. If brand new material would be more helpful in the future, do it. This was merely a first attempt at a reusable product.

It remains to be seen if this was even worth it at all. Keep in mind that this is all rather fresh. Nothing is set in stone. If it's not working, stop. If it's working. Write it down. If something's missing, find it and try it.


This repository contains everything that was used for the day (with the exception of a Slido account). There is also a .imscc file that is the compressed contents of our Canvas course as exported by Canvas itself. Canvas also has a course Import option so that file can be used as a baseline and modifications can be made.
